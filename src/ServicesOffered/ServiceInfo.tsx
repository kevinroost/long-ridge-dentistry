      <h2>Prophylaxis</h2>

      <p>Dental cleaning, also known as prophylaxis, is a dental procedure that involves the removal of plaque, tartar, and other debris from the teeth and gums. This procedure involves the use of specialized tools, such as a scaler or an ultrasonic instrument, to remove buildup on the teeth and below the gumline. The cleaning may also include polishing the teeth to remove surface stains and make them smoother and more resistant to future plaque buildup.</p>
        
      <p><b>Dental cleaning is an important part of maintaining good oral health, as it can help prevent gum disease, tooth decay, and other dental problems. </b></p>
        
      <p>It is recommended that individuals undergo a dental cleaning every six months, although this may vary depending on individual needs and risk factors.</p>

      <h2>Exams</h2>

      <p>During your exam, Dr. Mabe will examine the teeth, gums, and mouth to assess overall oral health and identify any potential problems. </p>

      <p><b>
        <u>The exam may include:</u>
        <br/> 
        1. Visual inspection of the teeth and gums for signs of decay, cavities, or other issues.
        <br/> 

        2. X-rays to evaluate the health of the teeth and underlying bone structure.
        <br/> 

        3. Checking for signs of gum disease, such as redness, swelling, or bleeding.
        <br/> 

        4. Examining the tongue, throat, and other soft tissues of the mouth for signs of infection, lesions, or other abnormalities.
        <br/> 

        5. Checking the bite and alignment of the teeth.
        <br/> 

        6. Screening for oral cancer by examining the lips, tongue, throat, and other oral tissues.
      </b></p>

      <p>Based on the results of the exam, the dentist or hygienist may recommend further treatment, such as a dental cleaning, filling, or other procedure, to address any issues and maintain good oral health.</p>

      <h2>Cavity Prevention</h2>

      <h3>Dental Sealants</h3>

      <p><b>Sealants protect the depressions and grooves of your teeth from food particles and plaque that brushing and flossing can’t reach.</b></p>

      <p>Highly effective in preventing decay on the biting surfaces of your chewing teeth, dental sealants are a simple procedure in which a tooth-colored acrylic “coating” is painted onto the surface of the tooth. This effectively “seals” the deep grooves, acting as a barrier and protecting enamel from plaque and acids.</p>

      <p><b>Children and adults can benefit from sealants in the fight against tooth decay.</b></p>

      <p>Easy to apply, sealants take only a few minutes to seal each tooth. Sealants hold up well under the force of normal chewing and can last several years before a reapplication is needed.</p>

      <h3>Flouride Varnish</h3>

      <p>Fluoride varnish is a dental treatment that involves applying a thin coating of fluoride to the teeth to help prevent tooth decay. The varnish is a highly concentrated form of fluoride that is applied to the teeth with a brush or applicator. It is then left on the teeth for several hours to allow the fluoride to be absorbed into the enamel. Fluoride varnish works by strengthening the enamel, making it more resistant to acid attacks from bacteria in the mouth. This can help prevent the formation of cavities and other dental problems. </p>
        
      <p><b>Fluoride varnish is safe and effective for both children and adults and is often recommended as part of a routine dental check-up. It is a simple and painless procedure that can be completed in just a few minutes.</b></p>

      <h3>Silver Diamine Flouride</h3>

      <p>Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a minimally invasive dental treatment that is used to help prevent the progression of tooth decay.  </p>
        
      <p><b>SDF is often used as an alternative treatment for patients who are unable to undergo traditional dental treatments, such as drilling and filling, due to age, medical conditions, or other factors. </b></p>
      
      <p>It is particularly useful for treating young children who may not be able to tolerate more invasive procedures. SDF is applied to the affected area of a tooth using a small brush or cotton swab.</p>

      <h2>White Bonded Tooth Fillings</h2>

      <p>White bonded tooth fillings, also known as composite resin fillings, are made from a tooth-colored material that is designed to blend in with the natural color of the tooth.</p>

      <p><b>White bonded tooth fillings offer several advantages over traditional silver fillings. They are more aesthetically pleasing, as they can be matched to the color of the surrounding teeth. They are also less likely to expand and contract with changes in temperature, which can cause the tooth to crack or break over time. </b></p>

      <h2>Onlays</h2>

      <p><b>When more than half of the tooth’s biting surface is damaged, a dentist will often use an inlay or onlay.</b></p>

      <p>Traditionally, gold has been the material of choice for onlays. In recent years, however, porcelain has become increasingly popular due to its strength and color, which can potentially match the natural color of your teeth.</p>

      <p><b>Inlays and onlays require two appointments to complete the procedure.</b></p>

      <p>During the first visit, the filling being replaced or the damaged or decaying area of the tooth is removed, and the tooth is prepared for the inlay or onlay. To ensure proper fit and bite, an impression of the tooth is made by the dentist, and sent to a lab for fabrication. The dentist will then apply a temporary  on the tooth and schedule the next appointment.</p>

      <p>At the second appointment, the temporary is removed. Dr. Hutchens will then make sure that the inlay or onlay fits correctly. If the fit is satisfactory, the inlay or onlay will be bonded to the tooth with a strong resin and polished to a smooth finish.</p>
