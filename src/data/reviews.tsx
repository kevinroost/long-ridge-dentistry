    review: 'Everyone is so warm and nice, they always make me feel comfortable and welcome before starting a cleaning or procedure. Everyone also really cares and is extremely passionate about their job. Best dentist office I have ever been too, will continue to go as long as I have teeth for them to do their beautiful work.'

    review: `Very professional and honest. I've been neglecting my teeth as of late. I had a 15 year old crown detach and made an appointment to have it looked at. They got me an appointment very quickly. The Doctor and staff were so professional and helpful. The doctor said "it looks like you could get a few more miles out of the crown" (as opposed to the crown needs to be replaced) They reattached it and made certain that the fit was perfect. Saved me over $1000!! A dentist with integrity, how refreshing!!
    I immediately signed up for a yearly dental plan. Long Ridge made me want to go to the dentist again. Forever grateful.`

    review: `Compared to past dentists and the one I switched from, Dr. Mabe and the clinic exceeded all my expectations. I was worried at first because I am still dealing with a root canal. I thought switching general dentists in the middle of a root canal may be complicated for my endodontist and me. However, Dr. Mabe was super attentive and knowledgeable. She even volunteered to touch base with my endodontist.

    The clinic experience was also great. They were able to move my appointment up a week or two. During the cleaning, the hygienist always looked out for my comfort. She said a few times to let her know if there was any discomfort. It seems like they are pretty booked. But if you don’t mind the wait, I’d highly recommended this place.`

    review: `Staff are very knowledgeable about what they are doing and what they have to offer. Staff at the front desk never smile. Need to be more friendly. First impressions are everything. Dr. Mabe is great. She takes her time with you and explains what she is doing and why she is doing it.`

    review: `Everyone is friendly and seems to enjoy their job. Dr. Mabe is very personable and never pushy about having this and that done which I personally appreciate because my previous Dentists have suggested crowns when that were not needed!
    I will continue to see Dr. Mabe!`
